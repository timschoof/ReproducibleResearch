# ReproducibleResearch

Workshop aiming to enhance reproducibility and transparency in research

## Issues to cover (in no particular order)

1. General principles

   1. Lower barriers of entry
   
      * Prefer free / open source to proprietary / closed
      
      * Use standards where available
      
      * [Recognise and avoid errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)

      * [Provide additional features as available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance)

2. Software sustainability

   1. Version control
   
      * Not just for code!
   
   2. Automatic testing (lowest level of documentation)
   
      * [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
      
      * [Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
   
   3. Documentation
   
      * Automatically-generated documentation ([where available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators)) reduces the risk of increasing the [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)
   
   4. Develop collaboratively to reduce [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)
   
3. Publications

   1. Make your work known
  
      * Publish in open journals
      
      * Distribute versions of your papers in other channels (personal and institutional websites, social platforms, etc)
      
   2. Publish everything
   
      * Papers
      
      * Code
      
      * Sample data sets
      
      * User-browsable results (use web technologies!)
